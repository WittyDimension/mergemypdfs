# mergemypdfs
This repository contains the application that can be used to **merge any number of PDFs** in a folder.

## Instructions (to use):
1. Download the Zip file.
2. Unzip it.
3. There are two way that you can use:
   - **_First_** - You can copy all the PDFs to be mergerd into the unzipped folder and then click on `pdfmerge.exe` to merge all the pdfs. All the PDFs would be merged to a single PDF named `result`.
   - **_Second_** - You can open the folder within the unziped folder named `SinglePackage` and put all the PDFs to be merged in it and then click on the file `pdfmerge.exe`. You will get the same result: All your PDFs would be merged to a single PDF named `result`.


The difference between the two is that later one is a single whole package.
